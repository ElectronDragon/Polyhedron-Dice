This is an Android app for generating random numbers as produced by the polyhedron dice used in Dungeons & Dragons.
The intention is to produce a simple, lightweight app that does what is wanted without loads of extra niche features, 
very much mimicing the simplicity of acutally rolling dice.

The app will roll up to four dice of a given kind at a time. Individual dice entries can be reset by long pressing the
relevant dice button, and the 'reset all' button will clear all fields in the app.

The files are complete (ignoring build/gen and build/bin), and can be dropped into an IDE for further work.
A completed version of the current app is also included, although my intention is to make it available from the 
Play Store as well.
